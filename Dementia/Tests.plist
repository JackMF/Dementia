If writing, say: “You will have two minutes and the letter is S.” If speaking, say “You will have one minute and the letter is S.” Tell the participant to stop when the device vibrates.

In part two the person copies/repeats these words. If writing, say: “Copy these words as fast as possible. I will time you. Ready? Begin.” If speaking, say: “Read aloud these words as fast as possible. Before you do this, check that you can read them. I will time you. Ready? Begin.</string>

If I say ‘7 1 9’, what would you say?&quot; If participant cannot complete the practice trial, another practice trial is provided at the level of two digits, before moving on to test items. If a participant cannot complete a practice trial at the level of two items, the test is scored as 0 out of 12 and no further test items are attempted. Advance warning that the number sequences will increase in length is provided at the start of each line of a trial.

In order to score a trial of a line as correct, participant must accurately recall all items in reverse order. No score is given for individual numbers correctly recalled in an incorrectly recalled sequence. If person gets at least one trial of a line correct, move on to the next line. Self-corrections are allowed; only the final answer is taken for scoring. Stop when person gets both trials of a line wrong.</string>
